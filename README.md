I referred to [Steve Jansen's batch scripting tutorial](http://steve-jansen.github.io/guides/windows-batch-scripting/index.html), [Microsoft documentation of Windows commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands), the output of SET /?, and the output of if /?

# unimportant information
I deleted a commit named "Add files via upload" and recommitted with "Add file via upload" (since it was one file)

I looked at https://devconnected.com/how-to-undo-last-git-commit/ and https://gist.github.com/heiswayi/350e2afda8cece810c0f6116dadbe651 for that
