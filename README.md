## references
I referred to [Steve Jansen's batch scripting tutorial](http://steve-jansen.github.io/guides/windows-batch-scripting/index.html), [Microsoft documentation of Windows commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands), the output of SET /?, and the output of if /? for command prompt

For the shells (Bourne shell, bash, zsh), I referred to the output of help and man commands, [Steve Parker's shell scripting tutorial](https://www.shellscript.sh/index.html), a [Bash guide](https://github.com/Idnan/bash-guide) on GitHub, and a nixCraft article by Vivek Gite

I also looked at [zsh documentation](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html#SEC3) on SourceForge and some [Scripting OS X](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh-part-2-configuration-files/) articles

[cplusplus.com](http://cplusplus.com/) and [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) helped me learn C and C++, which may have led me to use printf and the %c format specifier in the make_cr for the shells

## unimportant information
I deleted a commit named "Add files via upload" and recommitted with "Add file via upload" (since it was one file)

I looked at https://devconnected.com/how-to-undo-last-git-commit/ and https://gist.github.com/heiswayi/350e2afda8cece810c0f6116dadbe651 for that
